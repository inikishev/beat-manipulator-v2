https://github.com/inikishev/beat-manipulator except its v2

THIS IS WIP (use v1 for now)

whats new
 - using https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this for beat detection although havent tested it against madmom. It can potentially detect downbeats better so first beat is more likely to actually be the first beat, and bpm might be more accurate, but it is also less consistent. I might use a combination of both.
 - you can actually understand the code
 - the patterns are now way more poweful and stored as dictionaries (you still use patterns like `1, 3, 2, 4` but they get parsed into dictionary like pattern.yaml).
 - bunch of new stuff like effects and operations that i couldnt add into v1 because it was annoying to extend it (it was my very first programming project)
 - there will be less clicking between beats
 - i have some unhinged ideas that i will add
